= Overview

The Nemesis Backend Console is connected with the Nemesis Platform over your store's REST. It is used to perform CRUD operations on the database entities.

== Start the console

To start the console, first you need to know the address of the nemesis platform instance that you want to administer. Usually it's `localhost`, but it could be also installed on some other server. Once you know the address, you can go on and change the properties in the `appplication.properties` file to point to address where the nemesis platform instance is installed:

[source, properties]
.application.properties
----
server.port=8443
server.contextPath=/backend
console.restBaseUrl=https://localhost:8112/storefront/rest/
console.websiteBaseUrl=https://localhost:8112/storefront/
----

The next step is to  start the server:

[source, bash]
----
mvn spring-boot:run
----


== Login
Once the server is started you can navigate you browser to `http://localhost:8080/backend` and the login screen will be presented to you.

All of the custom files are located in the `custom_files` directory. When customizing, you must follow the same convention.

IMPORTANT: The files that are located in the `app` directory must NOT be modified. They will be updated on each console's update.
